## STACK FIVE ##
Stack6 looks at what happens when you have restrictions on the return address.

This level can be done in a couple of ways, such as finding the duplicate of the payload ( objdump -s will help with this), or ret2libc , or even return orientated programming.

It is strongly suggested you experiment with multiple ways of getting your code to execute here.

This level is at /opt/protostar/bin/stack6

### Source Code ###
```C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char *getpath()
{
  char buffer[64];
  unsigned int ret;

  printf("input path please: "); fflush(stdout);

  gets(buffer);

  ret = __builtin_return_address(0);

  if((ret & 0xb0000000) == 0xb0000000) {
      printf("bzzzt (%p)\n", ret);
      _exit(1);
  }

  printf("got path %s\n", buffer);
  return strdup(buffer);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  getpath();
}

```

There are two methods similar to stack level 6. Please check out stack6.md
